<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I’m Harshitha, an aspiring data scientist, creative thinker, and lifelong learner with a passion for technology, storytelling, and social impact.

I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Data Science, where I’m building skills in Python, SQL, and machine learning, while also exploring the exciting intersections of technology, healthcare, and entrepreneurship. My curiosity drives me to constantly learn—from coding new applications to understanding the complexities of human behavior.

Beyond academics, I enjoy speaking at events (including TEDxYouth), leading teams, and working on meaningful projects through my NGO initiatives and hackathons. My work reflects my belief that knowledge, when applied creatively, can solve real-world problems—whether it’s through research, community service, or building digital solutions.

When I’m not studying or coding, you’ll probably find me running, writing, exploring the world of visual design, or experimenting with healthy cooking.

I believe in staying curious, working consistently, and shaping a career that creates both personal fulfillment and positive impact.</p>
